<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>BIO</h2>
<p>The Cheyenne, Wyoming native has struck a keen balance between constantly challenging himself and staying true 
  as an artist, which has enabled his career to grow at an admirable rate.</p>

<p>Like any other tattoo artist, he paid his dues balancing a painstaking apprenticeship with music school 
  (he also works part time as a DJ, producer and sound engineer) until it started to paid his bills. It wasn’t 
  long, however, before not only his mentor but other tattoo artists in the shop began to take note of his rapid 
  progress and helped foster his fledgling career.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2016 and he’s been tattooing on a professional level for five years. While he finds himself most 
  drawn to neo-traditional and photorealistic designs, his years of experience equip him to emulate any style - be 
  it watercolor, trash polka, abstract, or anything else.</p>

<p>More importantly, what stands out more than anything else in each of Wirfel’s tattoos is a sincere passion for 
  his craft. Putting something permanent on another human being’s body that could potentially help them along on 
  their personal road is not something he takes lightly, and as a result, he’s forged meaningful friendships with 
  numerous clients along the way.</p>

<p>With a keen sense of sight and beauty, Wirfel is also a photographer. He photographs portraits, family, pets, 
  and scenery. Tucker has a very creative mind, and is artistically talented in so many ways. This is not to mention
   the projects he engages in on his spare time to fuel his never ending desire to create art. These projects 
   include designing custom sneakers, wall art, and interior design. Truly an artistic entreprenuer, Tucker was 
   made for unique design in every way imaginable.</p>

<p>You’ll be glad you enlisted Tucker Wirfel to design your next tattoo, or take your next photo shoot, and he’ll
   be more than happy to apply his natural talent, and sense of artistry to this important milestone in your life.</p>
